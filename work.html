        <div class="text-body">
            <p>I am located in Leeds, UK, and am looking for a role in which I can learn new skills and that allows realistic room for progression/ promotion. <br>
            Having a lot of experience in customer service, this is definitely a sector I'm happy to continue in as I know that I already have the foundations in place to provide an excellent service, which leaves me more room to learn new skills and improve on myself.</p>
            <p>Another area I do very well in is complaints handling, as I do not get flustered or offended when customers are expressing their displeasure, and I am able to de-escalate where possible, while working towards a reasonable solution as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>

            <p>I am also able to organise my workload effectively, and prioritise efficiently when under presser. <br>
            If you feel that I could be a good fit for your company, I would love to hear from you, especially if I'm actively looking for work!</p>
            <p>For more information about my experience, please feel free to read on through the sections below, and my public Curriculum Vitae is also available to download (<a href="Fyn Starr CV (Public).pdf" download>click here</a>), though as it is my Public version some information has been removed to avoid cold calling companies getting my information.</p>
