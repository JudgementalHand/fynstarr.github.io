            <p>Thank you for taking the time to come and visit my personal website.</p>
            <p>This site was originally just supposed to be a little project site for learning code, but I realised that some people I know have their own fancy sites to show their worth to the internet, and I got jealous - then this site was born. <br>
            At the time that I'm writing this very sentence, the site is a very basic static site hosted on github pages, and is far from being ready to reference to potential employers. However, it is going to be continually evolving as I learn new code and add to it.</p>
            <p>With that said, if you're an potential employer and you're looking at this site, chances are you're thinking that it's not very impressive compared to some of the WordPress sites most people would put themselves up on - and you'd be completely right in thinking that (at least right now you would be), but please keep in mind that every line of code was written by me, and I started it off as a complete beginner to programming.</p>
            <p>Take a look around, learn more about me. Feedback is very welcome, beit regarding the appearance of the site, the quality of the code, or how I present the information about myself; I'm always looking to improve!</p>
