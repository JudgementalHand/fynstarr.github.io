        <p>This site has been hand-written by myself, and is an ongoing project while I find my way in the wonderful world of web development and coding.</p>
        <p>So, while it may not be as sleek and fancy as other sites created using WordPress and the likes, it is an accurate representation of some of my own abilities.</p>
        <p>With that out of the way - welcome to my site, enjoy learning more about me, and please contact me if you have any questions/ feedback.</p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>
