            <p> This page is for detailed information about my professional experience, potentially relevant skills, and a more in-depth employment history.</p>
            <p>If you would like to know more about me as a person, you can jump over to my <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page, and you can also <a href="Fyn Starr CV (Public).pdf" download>click here</a> to download a copy of my public CV. Please note that as this is public, details such as my address and phone number have been removed, and can be obtained by contacting me via <a href="contactme.html" target="_blank">email</a>.</p>
            <p>I am currently looking for a job that offers room for progression and the opportunity to learn new skills. What I'm not looking for is another dead-end job that offers no progression or prospects for the future, as I feel that my initiative and ability to learn quickly is wasted, and I often go under appreciated. <br>
            If you think that I could be a good for for your company, then please don't hesitate to <a href="contactme.html" target="_blank">reach out to me</a> and we'll arrange a chat/ interview, be it in in person or over the phone.</p>
